Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room has an Android app named Draw It or Lose It. In this app players form teams and take turns guessing a drawing. Each team has 15 seconds during their turn to guess what is being drawn. If they cannot guess correctly then other teams have a chance to guess the drawing and get the points. The Gaming Room would like to take this Android app and expand it to the web so it can be used on multiple platforms. A good fit for this company would be a web app. It would have a similar feel as mobile apps, however, due to it being accessed through the web it is automatically cross platform unlike mobile apps.  

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I came up with a good solution for The Gaming Room. I recommended a web app because it is more versatile than typical websites. As of recent web apps can now be downloaded in some app stores like a real app making access easy. It also feels more similar to an app than websites do so it will have a similar UX to the Android app. This is important for friends playing on mobile devices because if not everyone has Android the web app allows them to play together. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document made me think about aspects of the process I would have not have otherwise thought of. While working through the document I ended up changing my original ideas quite a bit and going back to reflect that in the document. As I researched more of the pros and cons of web apps I had to tweak original statements, realized that maybe the original plan I had would not quite work I expected, and also changed how I felt about web apps in general. For instance, I originally thought that web apps were something that could completely replace mobile apps and my statements reflected that. As I researched more design constraits I realized that a web app cannot replace mobile apps completely. I learned where they fell short compared to mobile apps, but also when they are a good solution. For The Gaming Room who specifically requested to be on the web, web apps are a great solution. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the evaluation portion of the document. First of all, I struggled with the development requirements of mobile devices. I really had a hard time researching that part. I was not sure if I should be referring to programming on the operating platform as in making a website on a Mac versus a Window. Or perhaps programming for a specific platorm, for instance a website for a mobile device versus a computer. For example, you can create an application on Mac, Linux, or Windows computers but I would not create an application on a mobile device. I was a bit confused by the part that asks about the server side of mobile devices. I ended up answering each question as best as I could but I am not sure if it was correct. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I knew the user wanted to serve multiple platforms through a web-based game, therefore I recommended a web-app. To be honest I would just recommend they create an Apple app to go hand in hand with their Android app. I recommend this because if there are people playing on Androids, they may want to play with friends but cannot if there is no app for it. Depending on the demographic of the players of the game it may be more lucrative for the comapny to create an Apple app. Games like this are typically played on phones (think Trivia Crack or Jeopardy). A draw back of web apps is they cannot be downloaded in the Apple store, therefore Apple players would have to load the web app on their web browser to play the game. I do not believe most players wold want to do this, so Apple palyers are still not being properly reached. However, the client wanted a web based game. Therefore, I chose the second best option which was to create a web app which is more versatile than typical web pages. It can reach multiple platforms, i.e. computers and mobile devices. It is important to consider the user's needs, one so you have a happy customer, and two so that you create something the company is happy with the first time around. If the clients needs are not taken into account you may end up working on a project for weeks just to have them say it is not what they wnated and thigs need to be revised. This puts you as well as the client behind schedule.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
To design the software I did a lot of research. Before I could start planning I had to research different options and the pros and cons of each. While I started filling out the template I continued my research and I ended up changing my mind quite a few times. For example, I origianlly thought a web-app cold completely replace mobile apps and then I learned they did not. I think it is good to approach a problem with an open mind. That way better solutions can be found, even if it does take longer to revise your original idea like I had to. In the future I would take a similar approach as I found it really helpful in the planning stage of a project.
