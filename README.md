1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room has an Android app named Draw It or Lose It. In this app players form teams and take turns guessing a drawing. Each team has 15 seconds during their turn to guess what is being drawn. If they cannot guess correctly then other teams have a chance to guess the drawing and get the points. The Gaming Room would like to take this Android app and expand it to the web so it can be used on multiple platforms. A good fit for this company would be a web app. It would have a similar feel as mobile apps, however, due to it being accessed through the web it is automatically cross platform unlike mobile apps.  

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing this documentation, one aspect I believe I executed particularly well was the recommendation for The Gaming Room. After careful consideration, I proposed the implementation of a web app instead of a traditional website due to its enhanced versatility. Notably, the recent availability of web apps for download in certain app stores grants users convenient access, simulating the experience of using a native application. This approach ensures a consistent user experience (UX) akin to the Android app, which is crucial for enabling seamless gameplay among friends on various mobile devices. By leveraging the web app solution, compatibility barriers can be overcome, allowing a unified gaming experience for users regardless of their device platform.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document prompted me to consider various aspects of the development process that might have otherwise eluded me. As I engaged with the document, I found myself revisiting and revising my initial ideas extensively to ensure their alignment with the presented concepts. Through in-depth research on the merits and limitations of web apps, I encountered valuable insights that compelled me to refine my original statements and reassess my overall perspective on web app development. Initially, I held the belief that web apps could entirely supplant mobile apps, which was reflected in my initial assertions. However, as I delved deeper into exploring design constraints, I gained a nuanced understanding of the specific areas where web apps fall short in comparison to mobile apps. This knowledge allowed me to discern when web apps serve as an optimal solution. In the case of The Gaming Room, where a web-based platform was explicitly requested, web apps emerge as an excellent fit, meeting the project's requirements effectively.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one aspect of my work on these documents, I would focus on enhancing the clarity and understanding of the evaluation section. During the process, I encountered challenges in researching the specific development requirements for mobile devices. Initially, I had difficulty determining whether the reference was to programming on different operating platforms (such as Mac or Windows) or developing for different types of devices (e.g., mobile versus desktop). Furthermore, I found the question regarding the server side of mobile devices to be somewhat confusing. Despite these obstacles, I approached each question to the best of my ability, ensuring to provide thoughtful responses. Through perseverance and diligent research, I was able to navigate these complexities and gain a better understanding of the topic at hand.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I recognized the user's objective of enabling cross-platform functionality for their gaming application, leading me to suggest the development of a web application. However, it is my honest recommendation that they also consider developing an Apple application in conjunction with their existing Android app. This approach would facilitate gameplay between Android and Apple users, as the absence of an application on either platform could hinder the ability to connect with friends. Considering the target demographic of the game, it may prove more advantageous for the company to invest in an Apple application, given that games of this nature are typically enjoyed on mobile devices such as smartphones, similar to popular titles like Trivia Crack or Jeopardy.

Web applications, while versatile in their compatibility across multiple platforms, do possess certain limitations, particularly when it comes to distribution through the Apple App Store. Consequently, Apple users would need to access the game through their web browsers, which may not be the preferred method for most players. This results in a failure to effectively reach Apple users, highlighting a drawback of web applications in this context. Nonetheless, considering the client's specific preference for a web-based game, I opted for the next best alternative, which involved creating a web application. Compared to conventional web pages, web applications offer greater versatility and accessibility, catering to both computers and mobile devices.

It is essential to prioritize the user's requirements, not only to ensure customer satisfaction but also to deliver a final product that meets the company's expectations from the outset. Neglecting the client's needs may lead to prolonged iterations and revisions, resulting in significant project delays after weeks of effort. Thus, incorporating the user's perspective into the decision-making process is crucial for maintaining both client and project momentum.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?


In order to design the software, extensive research was conducted to inform the planning process. Prior to initiating the planning phase, thorough exploration of various options and their respective advantages and disadvantages was necessary. Simultaneously, while progressing through the template, continuous research was carried out, leading to multiple revisions of initial assumptions. An illustrative example of such a shift occurred when the initial belief that a web application could entirely substitute mobile apps was dispelled upon acquiring new information.

Approaching problem-solving with an open mind is highly beneficial, as it allows for the discovery of superior solutions, even if it entails investing additional time in revising initial ideas, as was the case in this instance. Reflecting on this experience, I would adopt a similar approach in future projects, as it proved immensely valuable during the planning stage. By embracing an open-minded mindset, one can effectively navigate the complexities of software design and development, ultimately yielding more refined and optimal outcomes.
